<H1>Details</H1>

This file implements a money class for representing and manipulating monetary values in C++.

- Supports initialization from strings and long double numbers.
- Provides methods to input (get) and output (show) monetary amounts.
- Implements arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) with proper handling of monetary format.
- Converts between string representation (e.g., "$1,234.56") and numeric type (long double) for calculations.

Designed as a student exercise in object-oriented programming from Robert Lafore's C++ book.
